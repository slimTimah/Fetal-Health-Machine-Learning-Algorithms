# Fetal-Health-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Project Title: Predicting Fetal Health Using Machine Learning Algorithms In this project, I explored the application of machine learning techniques to predict fetal health status based on cardiotocography data. The goal was to classify fetal health into 3 categories: normal, suspect, pathological.

# Importing Data
- To work with machine learning in Python, there are several libraries from scikit-learn (sklearn) that must be imported:
```python
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
- from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
- sklearn.model_selection for splitting data into training and testing sets
- sklearn.linear_model for linear regression and other linear models
- sklearn.tree for decision trees
- sklearn.metrics for evaluating model performance
```
